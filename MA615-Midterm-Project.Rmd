#Introduction
Topic: "Job Patterns For Minorities And Women In Private Industry, 2009 EEO-1 NAICS-4 Aggregate Report"
File name: YEAR09_CBSA_NAC3.txt
Resource from: 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/job-patterns-for-minorities-and-women-in-private-industry-2009-eeo-1-naics-4-aggregate-rep

#Import Data
First we import the data from the .txt file, using read.table here. It is noticed that the separation of this dataset is ";" instead of ",", which is the default setting, so we added the "sep = ";" argument. There is no missing values inside the dataset, or the missing values are valued instead of leaving them blank.
```{r import txt}
data <- read.table("data/YEAR09_CBSA_NAC3.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ";", quote = "", dec = ".", fill = TRUE)
```
This dataframe contains 600 columns, 9064 rows.

#First step, find missing values
however the first obvious mess is that, it is sure not each of columns is a single variable. Inside columns, 

rm(data)
data2 <- data



?read.table
rm("data")
